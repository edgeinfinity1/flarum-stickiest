### 2.0.1 (Stable)

- Re-built on top of `flarum/sticky` so if you disable this extension, you won't lose your sticky discussions.
- **Fix** permission related errors.
- **Fix** wrong badge tooltip for tag-stickied discussions.

Upgrading from previous `beta` versions (thanks for the test drive, upgrading to stable will cause losing your sticky discussion configurations - I didn't want to perform extra operations to keep them as the extension was in beta phase):

```
php flarum migrate:reset --extension the-turk-stickiest
composer remove the-turk/flarum-stickiest
composer require the-turk/flarum-stickiest:^2.0.1
php flarum cache:clear
```

### 2.0.0-beta.2

Possible fix for the nested `UNION` errors.

### 2.0.0-beta.1

Initial _stickiest_ release.
